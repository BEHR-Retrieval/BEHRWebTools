To run get_BEHR.sh, you first need to make sure it is executable.
In a Terminal (Mac OS, Linux) or Cygwin (Windows) window, navigate to
the directory containing get_BEHR.sh and execute the command:

chmod u+x get_BEHR.sh

This will add execute permission for the owner of the file only (which
should be you.)

You can then run it with:

./get_BEHR.sh

if you are in the directory containing it. Running it with no arguments will
print the help text which contains the most up-to-date instructions on using
it to actually download data.

Possible issues:
1) get_BEHR.sh expects your bash executable to be at /bin/bash. If it is not,
it won't run and you will get a "bad interpreter" error. This can be corrected
in two ways:
    (a) run it with the command
            bash get_BEHR.sh
        instead.

    (b) Correct the first line of get_BEHR.sh that currently reads
            #!/bin/bash
        by replacing /bin/bash with the correct path to your bash executable.
        This can be found with the command
            which bash
